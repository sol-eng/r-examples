## Pins <img src="https://pins.rstudio.com/logo.png" align="right" height="50"/>

The pins package can be used to publish data, models, and other R objects. Learn more about it here <https://pins.rstudio.com>.

## Palmer Penguins <img src="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="50"/>

The Palmer Penguins package is an R package created by Allison Horst that makes some data about penugins easily available to R users. Read more about it here <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>

This is what the data looks like:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  head() |> 
  kableExtra::kbl() |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

This is great if you have the `palmerpenguins` package installed in R. But what if you want to share this data with your colleagues who use python üêç?

This is where `pins` can help!

## Publish data to connect using pins

With `pins` you can easily publish data (and other stuff) to connect. In a few lines of code I can save this data to connect as a *pin*.

```{r}
board <- pins::board_connect(auth = "envvar")

board |> 
  pins::pin_write(
    penguins, 
    name = paste0(Sys.getenv("OWNER_GUID"),"/penguins_pins_r_demo"),
    # name = paste0(Sys.getenv("OWNER_GUID"),"/penguins_pins_r_demo"),
    type = "csv"
  )
```

You can now see the data on connect!

## Reading data from connect

Now that the data has been published to connect, you and and other uses can pull the data from connect.

You can easily read the data into R using pins:

```{r}
board <- pins::board_connect(auth = "envvar")

board |> 
  #pins::pin_read("sam.edwardes/penguins_pins_r_demo") |> 
  pins::pin_read(paste0(Sys.getenv("OWNER_GUID"),"/penguins_pins_r_demo")) |> 
  dplyr::glimpse()
```


## Environment Variables explained

The three variables that are needed for pinned content: 

 - CONNECT_API_KEY=**REDACTED**
 - CONNECT_SERVER=**REDACTED**
 - OWNER_GUID=**REDACTED**
 
Variables are being saved to the user level .Renviron config file when working on the file in Workbench. [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) has a function for creating and editing the .Renviron file: 

```r
library(usethis)
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Add the variables to that file in the format `variable_name = "variable_value"` and save it. Restart the session so the new environment variables will be loaded with `ctrl shift f10` or through the RStudio IDE through the **Session** dropdown and selecting **Restart R**. 

Saved variables are accessed inline with:

```r
variable_name <- Sys.getenv("variable_name")
```

See the Connect User Guide for adding the variables using the UI to deployed content: <https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/content-settings/index.html#content-vars>

## Git-backed deployments

Write the manifest: `rsconnect::writeManifest(appDir="pins-r-penguins/report")`
